\subsection{Promise 3: No buffer overruns}

\begin{frame}{No buffer overruns: Recap}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There's no pointer arithmetic in safe Rust
	\item Arrays in Rust are not just pointers
	\item There are runtime bounds checks for indexing
	\item But most stdlib functions use iterators, which are checked at
		compile time
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
